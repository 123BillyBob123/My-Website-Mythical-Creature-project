  <p>
    Scientists working in the Maldives have discoverd a never seen-before creature roaming the sea of stars. At night, when tourists flock to see the glowing sand, the creature rises up out of the glowing water, with a blue shimmering radiance surrounding it. Some people think that the creature glows because of the biolumenescent life. However, some speculate that the creature glows because of supernatural powers. Not much is known about these creatures though, and according to witnesses, it seems to be shaped similar to a human, and its entire body has a magical blue radiance.
